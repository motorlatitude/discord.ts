<h2>Declaration</h2>
<pre><code class="language-typescript" id="declaration" data-topic="<span>event</span>: &quot;RESUMED&quot;">event: "RESUMED"</code></pre>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>
    This event does not return any values
</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>
    This event is emitted after the connection to the Gateway was lost and resumed. This event denotes the end of incoming
    missed payloads.
    <br/><br/>
    Your project should be aware of the possibility of incoming payloads after a <code>DISCONNECT</code> event. These
    payloads will follow the same format as any normal event and will be replayed in order. The <code>RESUMED</code>
    event will be emitted once all payloads have been received and the connection is open again.
    <br/><br/>
    The library will automatically try to reconnect and resume the connection in most cases, in cases where this is not
    possible or the resume request is refused by discord, the library will automatically attempt to go through the full
    connection flow and create a new connection after waiting for 5 seconds.
