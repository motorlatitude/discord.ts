    Welcome to the DiscordTS documentation. DiscordTS is a NPM module written in typescript to communicate with
    the <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro">Discord API</a>. These pages are dedicated towards
    utilising this module to its full potential and how to go about creating a fully functional discord bot.
    <br/><br/>
    This is the documentation for DiscordTS version <code>v0.1.0</code>.

<h2>Reading These Docs</h2>
<p>
    This documentation is laid out to make it as easy as possible to find what you're looking for. These docs have split
    the various components of DiscordTS into separate classes and can be read individually by using the sidebar on the
    left. The main class and entry point for this module is the <a href="">DiscordClient</a> class. Each class will
    provide a declaration and an overview of its uses and will furthermore be subdivided into individual topics that
    will cover all available parameters, methods or events of a class.
    <br/><br/>
    These docs will also have a few different types of information demonstrated below;
</p>
<h3>Code Blocks</h3>
<p>
    Occasionally there will be a need to provide code blocks as a way to demonstrate some code or show the format some objects will take,
    these will look like this;
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// This is some code
const Client = new DiscordClient();</code></pre>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p>
    Sometimes there will arise the need to quote something, usually from the discord api docs. Quotes will look like this;
</p>
<div class="quote">
    <div class="quote-title">A Test Quote</div>
    <div class="quote-text">
        Just a quote
    </div>
</div>
<h3>Take Notice</h3>
<p>
    There are different levels of warnings that are colour coded for easy identification. A simple warning will look like this;
</p>
<div class="notification warn">
    <div class="notification-title">Watch Out - Something's A-foot</div>
    <div class="notification-body">
        Wumpus is on the run again
    </div>
</div>
